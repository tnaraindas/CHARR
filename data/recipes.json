Peanuts are not recommended. A fungus called aflatoxin naturally occurs in the peanut crop. Although the crops are inspected for it, a certain percentage is \u0011allowed\u0012 and since it is a proven carcinogen, peanuts are best left alone. Another reason peanut butter isn\u0012t recommended is that it is not possible to make a butter out of raw peanuts.
